
1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP1.1:-
   
  Multiplexing: It loads resources one after the other, if one resource cannot 
be uploaded, then all the other resources will be stop uploading.

  Server push: In HTTP1.1 server only servers content to a client device if the 
client asks for it.

  Header compression: Small files losd more quickly than larger one,to speed up 
the web performance it compress them to make them smaller.

  Prioritization: It refers to the order in which pieces of content are loaded 
due to this web page load time is affected. If the larger files loads first, it 
will block the other files and then the files that have been stopped will loads
last, due to this more pages load once at a time.

  
  HTTP2:-
   
  Multiplexing: It is able to use single tcp connection to send multiple streams 
of data at once and no resources is blocked, it is done by splitting the data to
binary numbers, so the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

  Server push: HTTP2 allows a server to "push" content to a client before the   
client asks for it and it sends message to the client to know the pushed content.

  Header compression: HTTP2 is more advanced compression method called HPACK 
which eliminates few bytes from every HTTP packet, due to this the volume of the
HTTP packets will load even a single web page by add up bytes quickly for faster 
loading.

  Prioritization: In HTTP2, the developers have detailed control over prioritiza-
-tion, which allows them to maximize perceived and actual page loadspeed to a    
degree that was not possible in HTTP1.1 and it offers a feature called weighted  
prioritization with the help of this developers decide which resources should load
first, everytime.
