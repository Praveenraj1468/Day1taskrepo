      objects, in Javascript is the most important data type and forms the buil-
-ding blocks for modern Javascript. It is different from primitive data-types   
(number,string,boolean,undefinedand symbols) because it all stores only a single
value each depending on their types. Objects are more complex because iy contain
any combination of these primitive data-types and even reference data-types.

     An object, is a reference data-type because the variables that are assigned
a reference value given as a reference or a pointer to that value.that the refe-
-rence or a pointer to a location in memory where the object stored. The variables
don't store the value. Objects in Javascript may be defined as an unordered coll-
-ection of related data, of primitive or reference types, it is in the form of   
"key: value" pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called as   
properties and method, respectively, in the context of an object.

For example:-
         
let details ={
            name  : "raja"
            email : "raja@gmail.com"
            mobile: "9857646573"
            addres: "123,nehru street,chennai"
        }
